The purpose of this assignment is to write a scc function in C code.

I am submitting README Makefile intList.h intList.c stackFunc.c stackFunc.h dfsTrace.c dfsTrace.h dfsPhase2.c dfsPhase2.h scc03.c test0.in.

scc03.c is the main function of the program, it contains the calls that actively print out all of our data. 

intList.c gives us our ADT functions.

intList.h is a header file.

To use the makefile you type in: 
make scc03

to start the test program use:
scc03 *filename*

I added many different functions to this program. I implemented a function to create a new stack that is called stackFunc. 
I also added the files necessary for a dfs as shown in the book, namely, DfsTrace and dfsPhase2. The various functions in these files will do everything from discovery and finish times to printing stacks and arrays

test0.in is the test that we were given.

The rest of the test files are random tests that I gave the program to try to
find a bug in it.
